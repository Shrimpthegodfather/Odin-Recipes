            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine flour, paneer, sooji, Nestlé MILKMAID, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix gently to form a soft dough, avoiding over-kneading.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 30-35 portions and gently shape them into round balls.</li>
            <li>Heat oil on low flame and fry the balls until they turn golden brown.</li>
            <li>Transfer the fried Gulab Jamuns into the cooled sugar syrup. Once all the Gulab Jamuns are added, bring the syrup to a boil again briefly, then remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your homemade Gulab Jamun warm, garnished with your favourite toppings.</li>

        <h2>Tips to Make Gulab Jamun</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Allow the dough to rest before shaping to ensure softer Gulab jamun.</li>
            <li>Divide dough equally and shape smooth, crack-free balls with gentle handling, avoiding kneading or excessive pressure.</li>
            <li>Make small dough balls since they expand while frying and soaking in syrup.</li>
            <li>Test the oil with a small piece of dough; it should rise slowly without turning dark immediately.</li>
            <li>Fry Gulab Jamuns on a gentle flame to cook evenly without browning outside too quickly.</li>
            <li>Let fried Gulab Jamuns cool a bit before adding to warm syrup to avoid shrinking.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped nuts or edible silver leaf for extra flavour and elegance.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in the above Gulab Jamun recipe, serve the sweet warm or at room temperature for the best taste and texture.</li>
