    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <strong>For the filling</strong>

        <li>In a mixing bowl combine water and soya keema granules; soak it for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a preheated kadhai or wok, add the butter, garlic, ginger and green chili</li>
        <li>Before adding the soaked soya granules, squeeze out the excess water and place it in the wok.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together and cook it for 2 minutes. The butter will bring out a very good flavour to the soya mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and carrots and stir everything. Add salt, pepper, schezwan sauce and cabbage.</li>
        <li>Cook everything for 2 minutes, do not overcook or else the filling will be very dry. Turn off the flame and set the filling mixture aside.</li>        
        
        <strong>For the dough</strong>

        <li>In a mixing bowl add maid, salt and water as required to make normal dough. The dough should not be too soft, sticky or too stiff. Once done cover the dough with a cloth and allow it to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>After 10 minutes, divide the dough into smaller portions, with this recipe you can make 20-22 large kurkure momos, you can also make 28-30 small momos.</li>
        <li>Once done, using a rolling board and a rolling pin, start rolling the dough into small round shape.</li>
        
        <strong>For assembling the momos</strong>

        <li>Once done, flip the rolled dough, sticky side up and place a tablespoon of the filling, in the centre.</li>
        <li>Start gathering the sides and edges, by bringing them closer and sealing it, by pinching it. This would be a braded momo.</li>
        <li>For the long momos, follow the same step and then join the two open side, pinch it to give it a slight folded design. Once done set it aside.</li>

        <strong>For making the batter and coating</strong>

        <li>In a large mixing bowl place the corn flakes, using you hand crush the corn flakes to smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl combine maida, corn flour, Kashmiri red chili powder, garam masala, chat masala, pudina powder and salt and pepper. Mix everything until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour little water at a time to make a thin batter. If you make a thick batter then the kurkure momos will be extra crunchy, and with thin batter it will be extra crispy.</li>
        <li>Lightly dip the momo’s in the batter and then coat the momos with cornflakes, similarly follow the same steps for the remaining momos.</li>
        <li>In a deep frying pan, heat the oil on medium high flame. Fry the momos in batches.</li>
        <li>Deep fry them until they are golden in colour. Follow the same procedure for the remaining momos. Remove on a kitchen towel. Set aside.</li>

        <strong>Serve</strong>

        <li>Sprinkle chat masala and serve the kurkure Momos along sliced onions and some schezwan chutney.</li>
    </ol>
